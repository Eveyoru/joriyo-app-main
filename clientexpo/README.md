# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Server Connection Feature

This Expo app includes a server connection status feature that checks connectivity to the ecommerce backend server. The app will:

1. Automatically check the connection to the server at `http://192.168.1.115:8080` when the app loads
2. Display the connection status (connected/disconnected) with a visual indicator
3. Show the server message when connected
4. Provide a "Retry Connection" button to manually check the connection

If you need to change the server IP address or port, edit the fetch URL in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
